* ROMFS - ROM FILE SYSTEM
This is a quite dumb, read only filesystem, mainly for initial RAS disks of installation disks.
It has grown up by the need of having modules linked at boot time. Using this filesystem,
you get a very similar feature, and even the possibility of a small kernerl, with a file 
system which doesn't take up useful memory from the router functions in the basement of 
your office. 

The first eight bytes identify the filesystem, even for the casual inspector. 
After that, in the 3rd longword, it contains the number of bytes accessible from the start
of this filesystem.

-> 754,496 bytes

The 4th longword is the checksum of the first 512 bytes (or the number of bytes accessible,
whichever is smaller). The applied algorithm is the same as in the AFFS filesystem, namely
a simple sum of the longwords
